### Performance and Scalability

9. ~~**How do you approach performance optimization on both the client and server sides to ensure a smooth user experience in mobile apps?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Understanding of client-side performance optimizations and server-side techniques like load balancing and database indexing.~~

10. ~~**What considerations do you make for scalability in a mobile app’s backend, especially during high traffic scenarios?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Experience with scaling strategies, such as microservices architecture, cloud-based solutions, and horizontal scaling.~~

### Backend Services and Third-Party Integrations

11. ~~**Have you integrated third-party backend services or APIs into your mobile apps? Can you give an example and describe any challenges you faced?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Experience with third-party integrations, understanding of API limitations, and problem-solving skills.~~

12. ~~**What is your experience with using cloud-based backend services, such as Firebase or AWS, for mobile app development?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Problem-solving skills, ability to diagnose issues, and experience working with backend teams.~~

### Scenario-Based Questions

15. ~~**Suppose you need to implement a feature in a mobile app that requires real-time data updates from the backend. How would you approach this task?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Knowledge of real-time communication technologies (e.g., WebSockets, Firebase Realtime Database) and strategies for implementing real-time features.~~

16. ~~**Imagine you are tasked with migrating a mobile app from a monolithic backend to a microservices architecture. What steps would you take to ensure a smooth transition?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Understanding of microservices, experience with system migrations, and ability to plan and execute complex changes.~~

17. ~~**If a mobile app's performance is suffering due to slow backend responses, what steps would you take to diagnose and improve the situation?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Performance troubleshooting skills, ability to identify bottlenecks, and experience with optimization techniques.~~

18. ~~**How would you design a mobile app feature that requires offline support and data synchronization with the backend once connectivity is restored?**~~

    - ~~*Look for:* Experience with offline-first design, data synchronization strategies, and handling network connectivity issues.~~

### Cultural Fit and Values
