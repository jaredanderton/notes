#### Replatforming 
- Highly tied into budget. 
- Cannot do run biz & replatform with current budget.
- Wes needs hard numbers on set on what it will take to end of 6/21
- Plan for starting it would be Q3.
- Jot is doing “bottom up” budget, meaning in the team/dept has creates own budget for replatforming project 

Jot pushed hard for Experience teams to have its own budget and its own #
- Future state: that budget will be allocated to me

# We only have 3 levers to pull 
(for the budget/replatforming project)
- How Long
- How Big / complex
- How many people headcount
^^ Turns the conversation into a math problem (takes emotion out of it, "what do we need to drop")

David Glass is technology interface w/ finance. Jot working with him on it

India - high level. Expectation is budget will drop by 25%. (Exit rate at EOQ4 (Jan) )
Q1 starts Feb
e.g 6/2024 - FY2025 (everyone hates it, just a side effect of something from a long time ago (shifting the month I think))


Devs involved in Replatforming 
- Taylor
- Matt
- Denna
- Joe Hansen
  - what are the challenges he ran into with Flutter/React Native + cocos



What are the challenges
Taylor posted a link - “strangulation pattern”

Core - “neat “ porject. Might be cynical, b/c we’ve said replatforming before

Test

Billy - Obj C
- Jots thought ”instead of using an SDK, they wanted us to go build a wrapper for glia”

Developing of SDK (externaly avail. 18 months, found out there was no biz for it)
Talk to Joe Hansen. 10 yr vet. Opinionated
Denna
Matt - most cynical

Org
Nate leads dedicated teams org -
Client dedicated (customers/ banks/ etc)
Pro-service - implemations / SOW team (new mobile customers) - Hancock Whitney 
(learn to hate to - trainwreck of a project) , teams is heavily engaged, I will need to at some point. 
For now can let is run, not worry about it. Large CU based out of Louisiana. And age of acc holder is 72 :grimace). 
Planned 5 dedicated eng (usually 15 though - borrowing from mobile core (should be dedicated) ).

Will need to discuss India hiring. (Nothing I worry about right now)

Report to me:
Nate (dedicated teams)
Implementations & SOW - TBH
Mobile core team will (something not handled by dedicated. Product led). 2 scrum teams (red & blue).

Had a candidate for Hanna replacement, ran into visa problems. I can leverage contacts.

Suncoast - in process of doing their implementaion. planned for 2 dedicated eng.

Core mobile application (helios)
Talks to synchronicity (rails monolith)
- since its the first, synchronicity is a blocker for a lot of functionality (req sync. Changes). 
- Feb of 2023 Only dedicated sync resource left the company.(Zoe) but did not backfill. 
- Jan ’24 mobile dedicated syncronity resource. Hiring a second (Mohammad: reports to nate) so these 2 can handle eachouthers PRs.
  Hiring rails?

Syncronocty talks to the rest of the services, for the company, a data store (cloud of services “that we really don’t care about”)
Mobile core owns
Path (Java) is what makes connections to customer institutions
e.g.  Initate txr of money. MX does nothing to Txr money. Path does all of the connections. 
Different mobile clients, connect to multiple path connector (not 1:1)

Wedge AFCO.
Brio -> Hughes (I think Hughes)
Platform baton ownership (SOA)

Ryan Jones only SRE mobile dev

Drew over the web org (continue to report to Jot)

Datadog - new for MX. cannot log in from link. Need to login from Okta. Only backend is using it.

Datadog does have a mobile RUM module. We are not using it. 
“Love to have much more visiviltiy into client behavior, not just crashes”

Another person in org I will deal with a lot @Olga Meydbray

Nandito - Wes’s peer. Billy reports to her. Been w/ company a while. Is a boomerang. Is a product for all experiences. 
Jot’s peer, but on product side. Mobile core PM is Henrique (w/ TBH for mobile core). Ava is doing all of mobile core. 
Ben Caldwell is acting PM as sun coast. (Ben related to Ryan Caldwell).

MT Talbot (We’s chief of staff)

Brian Stein long time MX’r (tribal knowledge well)
