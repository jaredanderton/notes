### Bad Reviews with good points
According to customer service, if you use a checking routing number to pay a bill it does not show up as a pending charge
in your account. Therefore leaving you to think you have more money in your account than you actually do. The convenience
of paying online allows you to not have to keep track or a detailed report of what you’ve paid. Why does the platform not
reflect a transaction as pending regardless if it clears or not and at least you’ll know that there is something that’s waiting
to be withdrawn from you account. Setting up an alert to let you know when you have a little balance is great, but it doesn’t 
help when you have a larger payment clearing and you don’t have the money in your account to cover it. Plus why does the app
not show your balance before and after transactions like the online banking platform does? This would be very helpful in the
app. I close an account of 25 years with another bank to come to America first credit union and I’m so disappointed. After
speaking to customer service about this incident they suggested I use a loan to cover my checking account in this type of 
situation. I am just trying to balance my account down to its last penny. Not take out money as I currently have money in 
the account or even in my savings account. Please look at other banking platforms and see how they do it. Please update your app.
